[Math Operations]

Math ops are used to mathematically manipulate registers
The form of a math operation is typically:
	operation register, value/register
The first register is the subject of the operation
For example:
	add rax, 5
	sub rbx, rax

Operations List

Op Name		Op Name (signed)	Description
add a, b	-			a = a + b
sub a, b	-			a = a - b
mul reg		imul reg		rax = rax * reg
div reg		idiv reg		rax = rax / reg
neg reg		-			reg = -reg
inc reg		-			reg = reg + 1
dec reg		-			reg = reg - 1
adc a, b	-			a = a + b + CF
sbb a, b	-			a = a - b - CF
