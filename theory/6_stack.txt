[Stack]

The stack, like registers, is another way to temporarily store data

Actions:

- Push: When you add data onto the top of the stack
- Pop: When you remove data from the top of the stack
- Peeking: When you look at the top of the stack without an action

ASM for stack operations

- push reg/value ; Pushes a value onto the stack
- pop reg ; Pops a value off to the stack and stores it in reg
- mov reg, [rsp] ; Stores the peek value in reg

Reminder from the flags_and_pointers.txt:

rsp(esp,sp) - Stack top pointer
rbp(esp,sp) - Stack base pointer
