A "label" is used to label a part of code

Upon compilation, the compiler will calculate the location in which the label will sit in memory

Any time the name of the label is used afterwards, that name is replaced by the location in memory by compiler

The "_start" label is essential for all programs

When your program is compiled and later executed, it is executed first at the location of "_start"

If the linker cannot find "start", it will throw an error

[Global]
The word "global" is used when you want the linker to be able to know the address of some label

The object file generated will contain a link to every label declared "global"

In this case, we have to declare "_start" as global since it is required for the code to be properly linked
